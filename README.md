# Go training
This is a traning repository to learn about go language. The goal is make a REST api to manage users. The rest api will have the next features:

* Create, update, delete and get users
* Token Authentication.
* Role base access control

I will use a postgresql database to keep de information and SWAGGER to test the API.
